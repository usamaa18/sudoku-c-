Final Project: Sudoku generator, solver and checker

Included Files:
	*MAIN.cpp
	*verify_full.h
	*verify_full.cpp
	*create_full.h
	*create_full.cpp
	*solve_brute.h
	*solve_brute.cpp
	*Makefile
	*sudoku.txt
	*README

Description: 
	*verify_full.cpp checks to see if an completed Sudoku is valid or not by checking rows, columns, and the 3x3 square matrix
	*create_full.cpp generates a solved or unsolved Sudoku (3 difficulty levels)
	*solve_brute.cpp solves a sudoku if you're unable to solve it

Running Instructions:
	1) Open the terminal and navigate to the correct program directory.
	2) Type in "make " to compile/link the program files.
	3) Type in "./MAIN" to run the program.
	4) When needed, the sudoku is to be typed in 9 numbers at a time separated by a space, then click enter, and type in the next 9 numbers, and so on, until all the 9 rows are entered in. Use 0 to indicate blanks. We have included a few sample test cases (sudoku.txt) for your convenience (copy paste them in).


Notes and Assumptions:
	-Only numbers are entered, no letters
	-User inputs the the numbers in the correct order and type
	-A 0 indicates an empty slot in the Sudoku
